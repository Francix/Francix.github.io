* [Everything within the VAE ELBO loss function](https://francix.github.io/blog/Everything%20within%20the%20VAE%20ELBO%20loss%20function.html) - Interprets every term in the VAE loss function, what they mean, and their corresponding parts in the code. 
* [Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory](https://francix.github.io/NaturalAnswer.html) - The explanation about the NAACL answer sentence paper. 
* [Memory Networks: Architectures, Attention Mechanisms, and Applications.](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-EN.html) - A short survey of Memory and Attention. 
* [Recurrent Neural Network from Scratch](https://francix.github.io/images/RNNfromScratch_fuyao.pdf) - A tutorial on RNN, best for people who knows it, but want some more in-depth discussion. 

Articles in Chinese:
* [音乐生成模型综述(Generations models for music)](https://francix.github.io/MusicGeneration.html) - 讨论了音乐的不同表示方法，音乐的直观特征 discussed different representation for music, and the intuitive features of music
* [Long-term Dependency and Global Coherence in RNNs](https://francix.github.io/MusicGeneration.html) - 接着上一篇博客，讨论了关于长时间依赖的一些方法论 Continued from the music blog, discussed methods and thoughts about long-term dependency.
