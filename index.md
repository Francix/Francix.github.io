### The Bayesian's Creed

Never let your shallow prior understanding override the truth of the world.

But fight for your deepest belief no mater what the world is.

My name is Yao Fu угдт░Д

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh. I am advised by Prof. [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) at Edinburgh and co-advised by Prof. [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) at Cornell. 
I finished my M.S. at Columbia University with Prof. [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) and my B.S. at Peking University with Prof. [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). 


I study machine learning problems rooted from NLP tasks, particularly generation and structured prediction. I derive probabilistic models guided by Bayesian principles, equipped with modern architectures, utilizing efficient inference, and grounded to linguistics and real-world scenarios. 

In terms of specific topics, I am interested in 
* NLP: Semantics; Text Generation; Structured Prediction
* ML: Deep Generative Models; Discrete Latent Structures 

Many topics that I'm interested in are covered by the following reading list:
* Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing. ([github](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing))
