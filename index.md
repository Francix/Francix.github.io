### The Bayesian's Creed

Never let your shallow prior understanding override the truth of the world.

But, fight for your deepest belief no mater what the world is. 

### General

Yao Fu угдт░Д 

I am an MSCS student at Columbia University (w. prof. [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/)). 
I finished my undergraduate at Peking University (w. prof. [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home)). 
Currently, I am visiting prof. [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/)'s group remotely in this quarantine. 
I will be coming to University of Edinburgh in Fall 20 (hopefully, with the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus) as a Ph.D. student. 

I study machine learning problems rooted from NLP tasks, particularly generation and structured prediction. I derive probabilistic models equipped with modern architectures and efficient inference, while grounded to linguistics and real-world scenarios. 

In terms of specific topics, I am interested in 
* [Text generation](https://github.com/FranxYao/franxyao.github.io/blob/master/blog/yaofu_NLG.pdf) and structured prediction
* Deep generative models with discrete latent structures and their optimization methods
* Model transparency, interpretability, and controllability

I am maintaining the reading lists about:
* Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing. ([link](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing))

Beside research, I love photography, boating and hiking. Follow [my ins](https://www.instagram.com/franx_yao/)

### UPDATES

* Sep 03 2019. Two papers get accepted:

  * _Paraphrase Generation with Latent Bag of Words_. w. prof. Cunningham at Columbia Stats. NeurIPS 2019. [code and paper](https://github.com/FranxYao/dgm_latent_bow)
  * _Rethink Text Style Transfer: A Lexical Analysis_. w. Dr. Hao Zhou and Dr. Lei Li at Bytedance AI Lab. INLG 2019 (oral). [code and paper](https://github.com/FranxYao/pivot_analysis)

* Apr 09 2019. I am maintaining a reading list about [Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing). This list originated from the [Columbia DGM seminar](http://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/teaching/GR8201/) class, then evolved to be more comprehensive. 

* Feb 15 2018, Our paper Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory is accepted by NAACL-HLT 2018! [paper](https://franxyao.github.io/NaturalAnswerGeneration.pdf) [blog](https://franxyao.github.io/NaturalAnswer.html)
