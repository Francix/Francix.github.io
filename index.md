## Hi there

### BIO

Yao Francis Fu угдт░Д 

I am an MS. student at Columbia University. 

I am interested in the interaction between the machine and the world through Natural Language. 
Natural Language Understanding is an essential step to achieve this goal, particularly at sentence level semantics. 
This includes how the machine shall learn the world through knowledge reprensentation (Knowledge Graphs), how the machine may understand the world through language (Language Understanding), and how to perform meaningful interaction (Question Answering, Sentence Generation).

### UPDATES

* Dec 22 2018. I will be joining Tencent AI Lab, Seattle in the Summer of 2019 as a NLP research intern. 

* Sep 15 2018. I did an Emotional Speech Analysis project at the Columbia Speech Lab, under supervision from professor [Julia Hirschberg](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~julia/). 

  * See the [blog about this project](Francix.github.io/blog/Attempts on the Emotional Speech Generation.html).

* Feb 15 2018, Our paper [Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory](https://francix.github.io/NaturalAnswerGeneration.pdf) is accepted by NAACL-HLT 2018!  

  * This is [a QA system aims to compose answer words into sentences](https://francix.github.io/NaturalAnswer.html). Given a question, the system is able to read the question, find answer words from information of different sources, compose these words into sentences with related information in the memory.
  * This work is my summer research project under supervision of Professor [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home)

* Feb 05 2018, I gave an [introduction](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-EN.html)([CN](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-CN.html)) ([EN pdf](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-EN.pdf), [CN pdf](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-CN.pdf)) about Memory Networks at Bytedance AI Lab. 

  - My summer research in 2017 is closely related to the memory networks. In this tutorial, I discussed multiple variants of attention mechanisms, and clarified the differences between matching based machine reading and reasoning based machine reading. 

* Dec 18 2017, I joint Bytedance AI Lab from December 2017 as a Natural Language Understanding Research Intern. 

  - My mentor is [Lei Li](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./leili/), director of Bytedance AI Lab, and former Principal Research Scientist at Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning. 
  - We are now focusing on sentence level models for music composition.

### PROJECTS

* Text Style Transfer In-depth (in submission)

  * Study the determinant of the class of a sentence. 
  * Analyze the underlying assumptions of state-of-the-art text style transfer systems and their performance. 
  * Study the one-to-many transfer problem. 

* Music Generation with Sentence Level Semantics

  * Background knowledge of music, and Midi File format. 
  * StyleNet for performance generation. 
  * StyleNet Language Model for music composition. 
  * StyleNet Variantional Inference for music composition conditioned on latent variables. 
  
* Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory

  * A QA system aims to compose answer words into sentences with information enrichment. 
  * Publication: Yao Fu and Yansong Feng, _Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory_, to appear in NAACL-HLT 2018. 

* [Recurrent Neural Network from Scratch](https://francix.github.io/images/RNNfromScratch_fuyao.pdf) 

  * I gave this tutorial to new undergraduate research students in [Guangyu Sun](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/team.php?action=show&member_id=15)'s (my former supervisor) Deep Learning Group at [Centre of Energy-efficiency Computing and Application](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/) (CECA). In this tutorial, I covered the story from vanilla RNN to LSTM seq2seq with attention mechanism.

* [Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations](https://github.com/Francix/Multi-Vehicle-Multi-Peroid-Dynamic-Tabu-Search/tree/master).

  * This project was finished during my exchange in University of New South Wales, Australia. 
  * It was a scheduling and routing model for food rescue (i.e. deliver foods to people in need) traffic distribution networks. 
  * It was an extension of my mentor, [Dr. Dyvia Nair](http://www.rciti.unsw.edu.au/staff/divya-nair)'s work in 2016. This work won the Tranportation Research Board 2016 Best Paper Award. 
  * Under Dyvia's supervision, I extended the algorithm into a dynamic version. 
  * Now it is being applied to the [OzHarvest project](http://www.ozharvest.org/), Australia's leading food rescue charity. 
  * Publication: D.J. Nair, H. Grzybowska, Y. Fu, V.V. Dixit, _Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations_, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences
  
* [Energy-efficient Drone Motion Tracking](https://github.com/Francix/Drone-Motion-Tracking)
  * An energy-efficiency tracking system with low latency for embedded system.

### MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND

* I come from a river town in Hunan Province, southwest China. Like the one in Peter Hessler's [_River Town_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94053.River_Town)).
