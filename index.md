## Hi there

### BIO

Francis Fu Yao 符尧 is an undergraduate research student at Peking University. 

My research interests are Natural Language Processing, particularly sentence level semantics, and Machine Learning. I am an editor and writer at _PKU Youth_, the largest student organized media in China, and this is why I do NLP! I like reading, writing, traveling and photography. I am also interested in Startups and [Innovation industries in China](https://francix.github.io/images/the%20chinese%20innovation%20industry.pdf). 

My [CV](https://francix.github.io/images/CV_FrancisYao20180112.pdf)

### UPDATES

* I gave an [introduction](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-EN.html)([CN](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-CN.html)) ([EN pdf](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-EN.pdf), [CN pdf](https://francix.github.io/MemNN-Fuyao-CN.pdf)) about Memory Networks at Toutiao AI Lab. My summer research is closely related to the memory networks. In this tutorial, I discussed multiple variants of attention mechanisms, and clarified the differences between matching based machine reading and reasoning based machine reading. 

* I joint Toutiao AI Lab from December 2017 as a Natural Language Understanding Research Intern. My mentor is [Lei Li](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./leili/), director of Toutiao AI Lab, and former Principal Research Scientist at Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning. We are now focusing on sentence level models for music composition.

### PROJECTS

* Music Generation with Sentence Level Semantics (Current)

  * Background knowledge of music, and Midi File format. 
  * StyleNet for performance generation. 
  * StyleNet Language Model for music composition. 
  * StyleNet Variantional Inference for music composition conditioned on latent variables. 

* [Recurrent Neural Network from Scratch](https://francix.github.io/images/RNNfromScratch_fuyao.pdf) 

  * I gave this tutorial to new undergraduate research students in [Guangyu Sun](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/team.php?action=show&member_id=15)'s (my former supervisor) Deep Learning Group at [Centre of Energy-efficiency Computing and Application](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/en/) (CECA). In this tutorial, I covered the story from vanilla RNN to LSTM seq2seq with attention mechanism.

* [Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations](https://github.com/Francix/Multi-Vehicle-Multi-Peroid-Dynamic-Tabu-Search/tree/master).

  * This project was finished during my exchange in University of New South Wales, Australia. 
  * It was a scheduling and routing model for food rescue (i.e. deliver foods to people in need) traffic distribution networks. 
  * It was an extension of my mentor, [Dr. Dyvia Nair](http://www.rciti.unsw.edu.au/staff/divya-nair)'s work in 2016. This work won the Tranportation Research Board 2016 Best Paper Award. 
  * Under Dyvia's supervision, I extended the algorithm into a dynamic version. 
  * Now it is being applied to the [OzHarvest project](http://www.ozharvest.org/), Australia's leading food rescue charity. 
  * Publication: D.J. Nair, H. Grzybowska, Y. Fu, V.V. Dixit, _Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations_, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences
  
* [Energy-efficient Drone Motion Tracking](https://github.com/Francix/Drone-Motion-Tracking)
  * An energy-efficiency tracking system with low latency for embedded system.

### MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND

* I come from a river town in Hunan Province, southwest China (Like the one in [Peter Hessler's](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94053.River_Town)). 

* I am a writer and an editor in _PKU Youth_, the largest student media in China. At first I liked classical Chinese literature, and this later led to my interest in writing, and this later converged with CS at Natural Language Processing. 

* I wrote [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NzAzMDEyNg==&mid=207701708&idx=1&sn=af6c76946c417c67ea0a9ec4ed609d6a&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=YTwnivIRJqtg1DPiWP6P&key=881e642d936f5123f1432c5de5c5145a775b510776e49537be0aa1d0f9f76e8bbb23f9c219c34fe26a6e8895f21200a8d99784a729d201c5697972d8ca661f0b5460377ce517f4a06a49b04c5207130b&ascene=0&uin=MjgzMjI2NjM4NA%3D%3D&devicetype=iMac+MacBookPro12%2C1+OSX+OSX+10.12.2+build(16C67)&version=12020010&nettype=WIFI&fontScale=100&pass_ticket=bMBmDNNw3zN8TAJ1yHz%2BlOI6hp9o5REtvH5ebc0cGecpTeOr%2B%2FO4BL1eeO6E5B9R) about my hometown, and [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NzAzMDEyNg==&mid=400112806&idx=1&sn=dba54d1e2d155b907a509930876df54f&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=1025rTqEKRU5aEBp5DplADjl&key=0054166caf6e68314f6c001271b87424fc9ad91983859a3c7c3c156708b79fa754e8fbe38314284289d6cf1d4e4e51cc4c180764474fc8a406d56d63e7eb3a2d286a7abd57d645fcb92edfa452075d7e&ascene=0&uin=MjgzMjI2NjM4NA%3D%3D&devicetype=iMac+MacBookPro12%2C1+OSX+OSX+10.12.2+build(16C67)&version=12020610&nettype=WIFI&fontScale=100&pass_ticket=0mNA7TJZaFXmisouHj5Pyc6k5krPTRZlKwGfbDHtMMjACYvoA2Ete3ngwNtTfWv3) about my high school in 2014 (in Chinese). Both of them were then published in PKU Youth.

### FRANCIS AS A BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDENT

In addition to my major in computer science, I am minor in business administration in Guanghua School of Management (GSM) in Peking University. This program focuses on startups, innovation industry, and entrepreneurship. 

* I wrote [this report](https://francix.github.io/images/the%20chinese%20innovation%20industry.pdf) about the innovation industry in China in 2016 Fall. 
* I did this report about the intersection of [medical industry and the Internet](https://francix.github.io/images/OnePic.pdf) in 17 Spring. 
* Recently, I lead a group and successfully applied new business strategies for [a startup](http://www.hg707.com) focusing on Chemistry industry information exchange. (17 Fall)

Mysterious Naming: "Fu Yao" or "Yao Fu"? why a "Francis" before "Fu Yao"?
