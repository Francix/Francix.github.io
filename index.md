### The Bayesian's Creed

Never let your shallow prior understanding override the truth of the world.

But fight for your deepest belief no mater what the world is.

Yao Fu угдт░Д. 

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh advised by Prof. [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). 
I am also co-advised by Prof. [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) at Cornell University. 
I finished my M.S. at Columbia University with Prof. [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) and my B.S. at Peking University with Prof. [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). 


I study machine learning problems rooted from NLP tasks, particularly generation and structured prediction. I derive probabilistic models guided by Bayesian principles, equipped with modern architectures, utilizing efficient inference, and grounded to linguistics and real-world scenarios. 

In terms of specific topics, I am interested in 
* NLP: Text generation and structured prediction
* ML: Deep generative models with discrete latent structures 
* Combined: Model transparency, interpretability, and controllability

I am maintaining the reading list about:
* Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing. ([link](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing))

Beside research, I love photography ([instagram](https://www.instagram.com/franx_yao/)). The cover photos of this page is a small collection of last year's highlights.
