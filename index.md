## Hi there

Francis Fu Yao is an undergraduate research student in Peking University. His research interests are Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. He likes reading, writing, traveling and photography.

Updates:

I just submitted my research about Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory (under supervision from Prof. Yansong Feng) to NAACL-HLT 2018.

I joint Toutiao AI Lab from this December as a Natural Language Understanding Research Intern. My mentor is Lei Li, director of Toutiao AI Lab, and former Principal Research Scientist at Baidu's Institute of Deep Learning.

* I gave this tutorial to new undergraduate research students in Guangyu Sun's (my former supervisor) Deep Learning Group at Centre of Energy-efficiency Computing and Application (CECA). In this tutorial, I covered the story from vanilla RNN to LSTM seq2seq with attention mechanism.

Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations.

* This project was finished during my exchange in University of New South Wales, Australia. It was an extension of my mentor, Dr. Dyvia Nair's work in 2016. This work won the Tranportation Research Board 2016 Best Paper Award. Under Dyvia's supervision, I extended the algorithm into a dynamic version.  

Mysterious Naming: "Fu Yao" or "Yao Fu"? why a "Francis" before "Fu Yao"?

My background

I come from a river town in Hunan Province, southwest China (Like the one in [Peter Hessler's](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94053.River_Town)). 
I am a writer and an editor in PKU Youth. At first I liked classical Chinese literature, and this later led to my interest in Natural Language Processing after becoming a computer science student. I wrote [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NzAzMDEyNg==&mid=207701708&idx=1&sn=af6c76946c417c67ea0a9ec4ed609d6a&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=YTwnivIRJqtg1DPiWP6P&key=881e642d936f5123f1432c5de5c5145a775b510776e49537be0aa1d0f9f76e8bbb23f9c219c34fe26a6e8895f21200a8d99784a729d201c5697972d8ca661f0b5460377ce517f4a06a49b04c5207130b&ascene=0&uin=MjgzMjI2NjM4NA%3D%3D&devicetype=iMac+MacBookPro12%2C1+OSX+OSX+10.12.2+build(16C67)&version=12020010&nettype=WIFI&fontScale=100&pass_ticket=bMBmDNNw3zN8TAJ1yHz%2BlOI6hp9o5REtvH5ebc0cGecpTeOr%2B%2FO4BL1eeO6E5B9R) about my hometown, and [this article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA3NzAzMDEyNg==&mid=400112806&idx=1&sn=dba54d1e2d155b907a509930876df54f&mpshare=1&scene=1&srcid=1025rTqEKRU5aEBp5DplADjl&key=0054166caf6e68314f6c001271b87424fc9ad91983859a3c7c3c156708b79fa754e8fbe38314284289d6cf1d4e4e51cc4c180764474fc8a406d56d63e7eb3a2d286a7abd57d645fcb92edfa452075d7e&ascene=0&uin=MjgzMjI2NjM4NA%3D%3D&devicetype=iMac+MacBookPro12%2C1+OSX+OSX+10.12.2+build(16C67)&version=12020610&nettype=WIFI&fontScale=100&pass_ticket=0mNA7TJZaFXmisouHj5Pyc6k5krPTRZlKwGfbDHtMMjACYvoA2Ete3ngwNtTfWv3) about my high school in 2014 (in Chinese). Both of them were then published in PKU Youth.

In addition to my major in computer science, I am minor in business administration in Guanghua School of Management (GSM) in Peking University. This program is focusing on startups, innovation industry, and entrepreneurship. I wrote [a report](https://francix.github.io/images/the%20chinese%20innovation%20industry.pdf) about the innovation industry in China in 2016. Recently, I am interested in [medical industry](https://francix.github.io/images/OnePic.pdf) and [Chinese AI startups](https://francix.github.io/summary_AI).

This blog is still under construction. There will be many interesting things (as well as a Chinese version).
