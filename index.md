### The Bayesian's Creed

Never let your shallow prior understanding override the truth of the world.

But, fight for your deepest belief no mater what the world is. 

### General

Yao Francis Fu угдт░Д 

I am an MSCS student at Columbia University. I will be coming to University of Edinburgh in Spring 20 as a Ph.D. student. 

Generally, I am interested in the interaction between the machine and the world through Human Language. 
Natural Language Understanding is an essential step to achieve this goal. 
This includes how the machine shall learn the world through discrete knowledge reprensentation, how the machine may know the world through language understanding, and how to perform meaningful interactions through language generation. 

In terms of specific topics, I am interested in 
* [Text generation](https://franxyao.github.io/blog/yaofu_NLG.pdf), structural knowledge representation learning
* Deep generative models with discrete variables and continuous relaxation of discrete Structures
* Model transparency, interpretability, and controllability

I am also maintaining the reading lists about:
* Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing. ([link](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing))
* Language Model Pretraining for Text Generation ([link](https://github.com/franxyao/Language-Model-Pretraining-for-Text-Generation)) 

During my MS study at Columbia, between ML and NLP, I focus more on the ML side. I will switch back to the NLP side in my Ph.D. study at Edinburgh. 

Beside research, I love photography. Follow [my ins](https://www.instagram.com/franx_yao/)!

### UPDATES

* Sep 03 2019. Two papers get accepted!

  * _Paraphrase Generation with Latent Bag of Words_. w. prof. Cunningham at Columbia Stats. To appear at NeurIPS 2019
  * _Rethink Text Style Transfer: A Lexical Analysis_. w. Dr. Hao Zhou and Dr. Lei Li at Bytedance AI Lab. To appear at INLG 2019 (oral). [code and paper](https://github.com/FranxYao/pivot_analysis)

* Apr 29 2019. I gave a talk about [table to text generation and evaluation](https://franxyao.github.io/blog/on_text_generation_evaluation) at [Interactions](https://www.interactions.com/). 

* Apr 09 2019. I am maintaining a reading list about [Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing). This is my reading list in the [Columbia DGM seminar](http://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/teaching/GR8201/) class, and I gave a detailed presentation about the [Adversarially Regularizaed Autoencoder paper](https://franxyao.github.io/blog/annotated_arae.pdf). 

* Feb 15 2018, Our paper [Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory](https://franxyao.github.io/NaturalAnswerGeneration.pdf) is accepted by NAACL-HLT 2018!  

  * This is [a QA system aims to compose answer words into sentences](https://franxyao.github.io/NaturalAnswer.html). Given a question, the system is able to read the question, find answer words from information of different sources, compose these words into sentences with related information in the memory.
  * This work is my summer research project under supervision of Professor [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home)

### PROJECTS
* Paraphrase Generation with Latent Bag of Words. NeurIPS 2019. 

  * A latent bag of words model with differentiable content planning and surface realization. advised by [prof. John P. Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/).  

* Pivot Analysis: An Lexical Analysis Method for Text Attribute Transfer. INLG 2019.

  * Text style transfer is recently a hot topic in NLP, but few have examined what determines the style and what is changed during the transfer.
  * We analyze the underlying assumptions of state-of-the-art text style transfer systems and their performance. 
  
* Natural Answer Generation with Heterogeneous Memory. NAACL 2018.

  * A QA system aims to compose answer words into sentences with information enrichment. 

* [Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations](https://github.com/franxyao/Multi-Vehicle-Multi-Peroid-Dynamic-Tabu-Search/tree/master). Socio-Economic Planning Sciences 2017. 

  * This project was finished during my exchange in University of New South Wales, Australia. 
  * It was a scheduling and routing model for food rescue (i.e. deliver foods to people in need) traffic distribution networks. 
  * It was an extension of my mentor, [Dr. Dyvia Nair](http://www.rciti.unsw.edu.au/staff/divya-nair)'s work in 2016. This work won the Tranportation Research Board 2016 Best Paper Award. 
  * Under Dyvia's supervision, I extended the algorithm into a dynamic version. 
  * Now it is being applied to the [OzHarvest project](http://www.ozharvest.org/), Australia's leading food rescue charity. 
  * Publication: D.J. Nair, H. Grzybowska, Y. Fu, V.V. Dixit, _Scheduling and routing models for food rescue and delivery operations_, Socio-Economic Planning Sciences
